- title: Why did it change?
  text: |
    We originally had our wedding planned for 7/29/17 in Rough and Ready
    but as of 3/23/17 we changed our minds.
    <br /><br />
    <strong>It turns out we just wanted to get married.</strong>
    <br /><br />
    We never really liked the clich√©s and formalities of traditional weddings
    so we decided we just wanted to celebrate with our friends and family.
